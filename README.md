This repository holds the code for a fun and functional React project I created: a Random Advice App.

Master the fundamentals of React workflow.

Integrated with the Advice Slip JSON API to fetch random advice.

Implemented social sharing functionality using the react-share library, allowing users to easily share  app's link on social platforms.
